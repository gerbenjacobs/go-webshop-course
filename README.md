# Golang Webshop Course

In this course we build a simple webshop with a REST API and a frontend page.

We will use some of the learnings from the [svc framework](https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/svc-an-opinionated-go-service-framework/), 
have a working shopping cart and use [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) for authentication.

For our frontend we'll use [Go HTML templating](https://gowebexamples.com/templates/), 
but since we'll have an API, a standalone frontend can be built as well.

So what are you gonna sell in your shop?
